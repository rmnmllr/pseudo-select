The script pairs two strings (in this case school classes) after the start button is pressed.
The selection appears random but isn't, the selection is made in the variable `pairs` which has indices of the pool of strings of the variable `fieldStrings`.

After a pair has been selected it is still displayed but removed from the pool of selection.
After all selections a message is shown and the button disabled.

An example of the whole thing can be seen on [https://muellerr.web.cern.ch/blink/](https://muellerr.web.cern.ch/blink/).
